# Privacy / GDPR Statement

## When located at primary location

The following statements apply to this site when hosted at
<https://new-oldnew-mashup.thecshore.com>

## No Cookies

This site does not use cookies for any purpose.
## Server IP Logging

This site logs the IP address and associated User-Agent Strings and URLS
connecting to this server.  These logs are used for security and rough
analytics (# of users connecting, approximate device, approximate
average lengths of visit, errors generated, and similar information).
No other potentially personally identifying information is gathered
during the visit, and the logs are periodically rotated.  The aggregate
data gathered from the logs is regularly purged as well.

The site logs are created and maintained by the hosting service, so
is a third party outside the site operator's control.

## No cloud-connected analytics

This site does not use any analytics from services such as Google,
Facebook, or other 'cloud'-based analytics offerings.  At the present
time the site do not gather analytics beyond the site logs, either and
will add a news item and the information here if this changes.

## Third Party Tools -- Hosted Locally, No Known Analytics, But...

This site uses some third party CSS and Javascript code which is hosted
directly on this site (so no analytics result from CDN access, for
example), while the site operator has examined the third party code and
not found any offsite access (analytics or otherwise) however it is
difficult to guarantee that there no analytics embedded within the code.
As such the does not provide a guarantee that no analytics are present.
As always use cookie and tracker blocking (such as Privacy Badger for
Firefox).

## Offsite Images and Other Offsite Content

This site hosts all content required for serving the pages and images
on this on site locally.  That is your browser does not, nor does this
site, make requests for offsite content in order for you to view this
site.  There was a period where this site inadvertently included image
links to various badges and status notifications related to the code.
Those have been moved to the README.md which is only displayed via the
Git hosting service and does not appear on this site.

## Search Function Is Purely Local

The search function in the menu bar does not require access to any third
party sites (i.e. no Google or other search engines) and uses a local
index and local Javascript to perform the search and display the
results.  Unforunately it doesn't work with IE11.


## GDPR

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a law that governs
privacy for the EU (European Union).  To the best of the site operator's
knowledge this site complies with that regulation, even though as a
Canadian owned and operated site it does not need to do so.
